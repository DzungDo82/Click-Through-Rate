# Click-Through Rate (CTR) project
### Tools used: SQL and Python (Machine Learning - imbalance dataset)

-	Measured the click-through rate by comparing the number of clicks on an ad within the payment app to the number of impressions it received.
-	Skilled in handling imbalanced datasets (92% vs. 8%) and discovered the optimal combination of Standard Scaler + SMOTE + Random Forest Classifier, achieving a predictive accuracy score of 73%.
-	SQL: Designed table schemas and assembled a modeling dataset of over 2 million rows.
-	Python: Utilized SQL Alchemy for connection and table loading, conducted feature engineering, binning, visualization, data cleaning, and model training.
